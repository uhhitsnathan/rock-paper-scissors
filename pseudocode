function get computer choice
want to have console display string rock paper or scissors first
creating an array with 3 strings named rock paper and scissors
use math.random and indexOf to randomly choose an index from the array and then return it with a console.log statement or a return so i can call the method later
array = {'rock' , 'paper' , 'scissors'};//array as global variable just in case
function getComputerChoice(){
return indexOf(math.random.math.floor blah blah blah

then that will return a random string of rock paper scissors to the console


need to make a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors
this means that the user will input a non-case-sensitive value, rock, paper, or scissors
after the user inputs that value, the getComputer choice will execute
based on the user input vs the random computer output, a message will be displayed

function gameRound(playerinput, computerchoice){
console.log("CHOOSE ROCK PAPER OR SCISSORS");
alert eventlistener(): or whatever needs to be done to get player input: equivalent of java scanner.
getComputerchoice()
if userinput =
